[1] I have first hand experience with this adapter.
[2] Longest range of any adapter that I have ever tested.
[3] Excellent for 5 GHz AP mode (works well with a Raspberry Pi 4B to build your own WiFi router/access point)
[4] Only supports managed and monitor modes. Low cost.

Criteria to make The Short List: 

1. Use an In-kernel driver (adapter is plug and play).
2. Single State (usb_modeswitch not required).
3. Solid and stable with either a well documented track record or my own testing experience.
4. Well built with good materials.
5. Widely available to purchase as a new product.
