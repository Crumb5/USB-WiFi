[1] I have first hand experience with this adapter.
[2] Longest range of any adapter that I have ever tested.
[3] Excellent for 5 GHz AP mode (works well with a Raspberry Pi 4B)
[4] Only supports managed and monitor modes. Low cost.

Criteria to make The Short List: 

1. Use an In-kernel driver (adapter is plug and play).
2. With either a well documented track record or my own testing experience.
3. Widely available to purchase as a new product.

USB WiFi adapters come in various shapes, sizes and speeds. Their capabilities
can vary greatly well. The adapter that you pick needs to be chosen based on its
ability to do the job that you need it to do. Below are some recommendations
based on specific use cases:

If you want to build your own WiFi Router/Access Point/Hotspot:

5 GHZ: Alfa AWUS036ACM, TEROW ROW02FD, COMFAST CF-WU782AC

2.4 GHz: Alfa AWUS036NHA, K2-544DW, Panda PAU06, Alfa AWUS036NEH
