##   USB-WiFi MAIN MENU

Note: While this site is maintained by Linux users for Linux users, Windows users are welcome also. No, we don't intend to add support for
USB WiFi adapter use on Windows but the list of adapters shown in menu item 2 contains information and links to a lot of good quality
adapters that also work well in Windows.

The mission of this site is to collect information and provide links regarding the purchase and use of USB WiFi adapters with Linux.
